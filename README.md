**Celestial**, the *one* and *only* core you will ever need for your HCF server.

(I do not own the image above.)

## Overview

### About

Celestial features an optimized code-base, documented for the noobiest of noobs, and is overall free and open-source.
The reason that I am making this open source is because one, I need something for my portfolio and two, I like open-source projects.

As the famous Linus Torvalds, most known for his contributions in the foundations of Linux, once said:
> "Software is like sex: it's better when it's free."

which is to be taken as gospel.

Everyone is welcome to make pull-requests and contribute to this project. As well as the issues page will be checked daily, if not, every other day. I will also not be making a Wiki due to the fact that *mostly* everything is documented and that I'm a very lazy individual among society.
However, if someone were to help make one, I'd be more than delighted to add you as a contributor to the repo.

If you do make a contribution, please try to be sure to comment/document all of the changes and/or additions you made to the project.

### How To Install

Installation instructions:

1. Download and install [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. Clone the repo via either SSH, HTTPS, or if you're lazy, just use a Git program. Or you could be lazy and just download the source as one ZIP file.
3. If you downloaded the ZIP, extract it into the directory of your choosing. Go into the main directory of the repo and then go to that directory in your Windows Command Prompt, Linux Console, or MacOS Terminal.
4. From there, type in `mvn clean install` and Maven should automatically detect the pom.xml file inside of the root directory. Alternatively, if you do not wish to install it directly into your maven repository, simply type in `mvn clean package` instead.

### FAQ

1. How often will this be updated?

    I will try my best to update this every day, if not, every other few days or so. I'm pretty busy with school, learning new languages, and/or eating in my free time so that's what I'll be doing if I'm not updating this.

2. Haven't been asked anything other than that :(
