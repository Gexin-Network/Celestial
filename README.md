**Celestial**, the *one* and *only* core you will ever need for your HCF server.

## Overview

### About

Celestial features an optimized code-base, documented for the noobiest of noobs, and is overall free and open-source.
The reason that I am making this open source is because one, I need something for my portfolio and two, I like open-source projects.

As the famous Linus Torvalds, most known for his contributions in the foundations of Linux, once said:
> "Software is like sex: it's better when it's free."

which is 100% gospel and fact.

Contributors are welcome to make pull-requests. As well as the issues page will be checked daily, if not, every other day. I will also not be making a Wiki due to the fact that I'm a very lazy individual. However, if someone were to help make one, I'd be more than delighted to add you to the repo.

### How To Install

Installation instructions:

1. Download and install [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. Clone the repo via either SSH, HTTPS, or if you're lazy, just use a Git program. Or you could be lazy and just download the source as one ZIP file.
3. If you downloaded the ZIP, extract it into the directory of your choosing. Go into the main directory of the repo and then go to that directory in your Windows Command Prompt, Linux Console, or MacOS Terminal.
4. From there, type in `mvn clean install` and Maven should automatically detect the pom.xml file inside the root of the directory.
